# friendjoin

Normally, when you host a Minecraft server at home, the server is private.

This is a script that allows you to publish your server for your friends.

### Installing

```sh
npm install friendjoin
```

### Running

```sh
npx friendjoin
```

Once the script is ran, you'll get a menu of commands:

### Hosting

```sh
/host
```

### Joining
```sh
/join <friend's server id here>
```

Note:
You'll need Node.js downloaded and installed on your computer in order for the "npm" and "npx" commands to exist.

You can get Node.js TLS here:
